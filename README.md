# Building a single-pixel camera system thesis code

As my Physics final thesis, a single-pixel camera prototype was developed, using an IDS camera and an Icodis projector. The code directory includes all scripts needed to set up and control the camera, and to process and analyze the output data.

[Check out the thesis!](https://github.com/Willy8m/TFG-Single-Pixel-Imaging/blob/main/____THESIS____.pdf) (or [Jump straight to the code](https://github.com/Willy8m/TFG-Single-Pixel-Imaging/tree/main/code) instead)

_*Abstract:*_ *Single-pixel cameras use a single light sensor, combined with a projection of illumination patterns, to scan an object and reconstruct an image. In this report, the effect of the position of the illumination system is studied, and a novel method for medical imaging is proposed using single-pixel imaging.*
