# TFG Single Pixel imaging

As part of my Physics degree final thesis, a single-pixel camera prototype was developed, using an IDS camera and an Icodis projector. This repository will serve as a guide on how to replicate the steps taken to construct the camera and a public showcase of my work.

## Thesis 

_**Abstract**_ Single-pixel cameras use a single light sensor, combined with a projection of illumination patterns, to scan an object and reconstruct an image. In this report, the effect of the position of the illumination system is studied, and a novel method for medical imaging is proposed using single-pixel imaging.

## Code

Code to set up and control the camera, and to process and analyze the output data.
