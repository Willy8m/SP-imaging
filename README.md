# Final report

_**Abstract**_ Single-pixel cameras use a single light sensor, combined with a projection of illumination patterns, to scan an object and reconstruct an image. In this report, the effect of the position of the illumination system is studied, and a novel method for medical imaging is proposed using single-pixel imaging.

# Code

Code to setup and control the camera, and to process and analyse data.
